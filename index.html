                <h2>My Career in Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Response Services Technician with a strong focus on
                    cybersecurity, I've developed expertise in vulnerability
                    management, penetration testing, and incident response.
                    Below, you'll find examples of my work, including detailed
                    vulnerability reports that showcase my ability to identify,
                    assess, and mitigate security risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work is driven by a passion for keeping systems secure,
                    whether through hands-on technical work or by developing
                    strategies to protect against emerging threats. I am
                    currently studying for my CySA+ certification, which will
                    further enhance my ability to protect and defend networks.
                </p>
                <h3>Vulnerability Reports</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the vulnerability reports I've prepared,
                    demonstrating my ability to identify and address security
                    issues effectively:
